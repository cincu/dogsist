üêï Stray Dogs of Istanbul: History, Ownership, and Coexistence
Welcome to the Stray Dogs of Istanbul project, a web application developed as part of my Master's thesis. This project explores the history of stray dogs in Istanbul, delves into the complex issue of ownership, and proposes sustainable solutions to the challenges they present, while advocating for their respectful co-existence.

üìö Project Overview
Stray dogs have been a part of Istanbul's history for centuries, symbolizing both the city‚Äôs rich cultural heritage and the ongoing challenges of urban cohabitation. This project aims to shed light on the following key areas:

Historical Context: Understanding the long-standing relationship between the city and its stray dogs.
Ownership Challenges: Investigating the legal and social aspects of stray dog ownership.
Data Visualization: Integrating Datawrapper to create dynamic maps and visualizations that illustrate the distribution and movement of stray dogs across the city.
Proposed Solutions: Presenting two innovative solutions to manage the stray dog population, ensuring humane treatment while minimizing potential issues.
üõ† Features
Interactive Map Visualization: Using Datawrapper, the project visualizes the locations and movements of stray dogs in Istanbul.
Historical Insights: A comprehensive overview of the history and cultural significance of stray dogs in Istanbul.
Solution Proposals: Offering two potential strategies to address the challenges associated with stray dogs while promoting peaceful co-existence.
