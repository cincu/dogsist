        Feral dogs, street dogs have existed from Judeo-Christian traditions in
        European contexts to Asia and Eurasia who had very different culture and
        religions in history. The joint factor is that all societies across the
        globe has experienced a history of capitalism that also includes
        colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism which shifted how humans
        perceive this social community that has long existed among humans. These
        street dogs that could be stray dogs, free-roaming dogs with or without
        owners, were with humans before streets existed (Alkan, 2016). James
        Serpell (1995) says; ‘the existence of feral dogs, and the widespread
        cruelty, intolerance and indifference that dogs experience throughout
        the world, serves to illustrate the curious ambivalence of human
        attitudes towards this affectionate and supremely useful animal’. Even
        though the topic remains controversial, it is crucial to know the
        historical examples to understand how humans created streets and decided
        that as an indicator of modernity and civilization, these spaces should
        be clean and free of non-human animals; in this case dogs. The objective
        of this topic is to inform the readers that dogs existed thousands of
        years before as a part of the society, whether similar to current
        accepted concepts or completely different.
