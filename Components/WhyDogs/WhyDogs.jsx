        The relationship between dogs and humans are more entangled than it
        seems; now called the ‘interspecies structural pairing’, the hunter and
        the dog couple was the first example of human and animal skills combined
        for mutual benefits. Further on, dogs are often referred as companion
        species in modern day, a co-constitutive relationship in which both
        sides are responsible of making each other up. This idea indicates that
        dogs and humans evolved together, moreover, they shaped each other
        through thousands of years. In urban level, after the industrial
        revolution when demand for mass production grew with populations, an era
        of standardization and homogenization of the urban spaces started. In
        this instance in some regions due to different factors such as religion,
        culture and folklore, dogs still freely roam in the cities and they are
        the bodies that humans can’t control and dogs create an opposition to
        capitalist and single user (humans) reign of the urban nature. They
        simply symbolize a rebellion of the nature with their unpredictable and
        non-human behavior, movement and existence. The city and the widespread
        study of urbanism that we are accustomed to usually overlooks these
        non-human creatures because they adapt but they don’t obey. Knowing the
        human-canine relationships and how they were formed in different
        contexts will give a perspective for future approaches. The
        transformation that occur in the cities, changes the human relationship
        with non-human living beings. The mentality and understanding in
        different cultures have different outcomes. The following chapter will
        examine this shift through various time periods in different geographies
        in the world.
