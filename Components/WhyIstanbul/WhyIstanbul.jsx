      <h4>City and People</h4>
      <p>
        There are two main reasons why the study choses to analyze Istanbul
        (besides the current existence of street dogs in the city). The first
        one is the city’s ever-expanding human demography and the historical
        change in settlements. In order to comprehend the situation better, one
        should understand it from the very beginning. The approximate population
        of the forager people was estimated to be between 3 to 8 million, across
        the world. Today this number only equals to population of an average
        metropolis. Hence, the first 999 thousand years of humankind on earth
        –in other words 99% of human history- the speed of population growth is
        low. From that time, significant events such as start of agriculture
        speeds up this rate, eventually, in 1750, the population is estimated as
        750 million. After this period, the rate accelerates continuously. From
        a population growth rate of 36/100 000 after Neolithic Period turns into
        4,4/1000 in the second half of 18th century, to 5,3% eventually in the
        beginning of 20th century. In the beginning of 19th century, the world
        population was less than India’s population in 2015, moreover, only 3%
        of this lived in urban areas. Towards 20th century, the number increased
        only to 14% of the total world population. In 1950s, the population grew
        to be 2,5 billion, only 30% were living in cities (PRB, 2015). Finally,
        in 2007 the urban population exceeds the rural population for the first
        time. Currently, 55% of the world population lives in cities, which
        equals to 4,2 billion people. The average rate of urbanization is given
        as; 82% in North America, 80% in OECD countries, 81% in Latin America
        and Caribbean, 76% in Euro zone and 75% in European Union (PRP, 2017; UN
        DESA, 2018). Hosting more than half of the total population; the cities,
        only form 3% of the world land surface. In other words, the method of
        human occupation in today’s world is through geographically spreading
        and spatially densifying. More specifically, in the beginning of 20th
        century, there were only 12 cities that harbored more than 1 million
        people. In 1950s that number rose to 83, and today, 8 city-dwellers out
        of 10 lives in a city over 10 million population. Inherently, Istanbul
        is one of the great proofs of this occurrence. Currently it is the most
        populated city in Europe and 6th in whole world. Although the city’s
        socio-cultural, economic and religious significance that dates back to
        thousands of years ago, the increase in population growth cannot be
        ignored. While in 1950s the population of Istanbul was recorded as 983
        000, in 2019 the official number was over 15 million. Moreover, as it is
        for every developing mega-polis, migration from rural cities and towns
        (from east of Turkey), to Istanbul accelerates the urbanization process
        since beginning of 20th century. Currently, only 15% of inhabitants
        officially reside in Istanbul.

      <h4>Istanbullu and Street Dogs</h4>
      <p>
        Lynn White, argues in his essay ‘the historical roots of our ecological
        crisis’ in 1967, scientific rationalism on our current ecological
        paradigm is based in the worldview of Western Christendom; ‘the most
        anthropocentric religion the world has seen’. This notion is deeply
        influential both in ecology and human-animal relations. Even though
        western speciesism had emerged in Christian lands, there is no certainty
        of well-being of the non-human animals in urban spaces. Soon enough,
        East has started exploiting non-human animals and ecology for various
        reasons, utilization for human needs, ritualization for religions, or
        simply obliterate species for hygiene and safety reasons. Street dogs
        have had a prominent existence in Turkey and ‘historically a part of the
        cultural landscape’, travelers to Istanbul have acknowledged this in
        many memoirs in 17th century (Fortuny, 2014). According to Alan Mikhail
        (2017), Muslim cities were the largest urban environments between 8th
        and 18th centuries across the globe and dogs served important roles.
        Authorities supported street dogs as they were the primary consumers of
        waste, to keep the cities clean. Recordings of Muslim authorities
        building watering troughs for dogs, many religious institutes (mosques)
        fed them and butchers kept them around to keep away vermin such as rats.
        Violence against these dogs were punished and Muslim cities were cleaner
        and much pleasant places with dogs. Writers such as Mark Twain and
        Edmondo de Amicis, in the late 19th century remarked upon their
        existence in the city and called them ‘the second population in the
        city’ (Amicis, 1896).{" "}
